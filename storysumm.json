        "story": "There's a beach on the Southern coast of California where the sky is pink and orange and palm trees in the view. The ocean is lightly roaring and crashing on the sand. The sound of traffic is muted by a beautiful voice. A song calling from just beyond vision's reach.\nDaniel searched for the source. The song continued. Daniel walked closer to the water and peered out into the deep. Then, in the moment he saw her, the sky went black and time came to a stand still; A mermaid was sitting on a rock.\nDaniel rubbed his eyes, trying to make sense of what he was seeing. He called out, and waved. The mermaid waved back and motioned him to come over. Daniel, had no way out to the rock. He ran up and down the beach, past the frozen people, looking for a board or floaty, something that would let him cross the water. Finding no suitable options, he yelled \"One second!\" and headed toward the marina.\nDaniel was no expert on boating but, he knew enough to get one running. He did not know enough to avoid bumping into the boat behind him. To his great annoyance, he watched as one of the frozen people fell overboard. He jumped in after them, got them out, and righted them on the boat. Returning to the one he'd started, he headed toward the rocks.\nAbout halfway there, he noticed that the song the mermaid was singing had stopped. As he got closer, the mermaid got larger and decidedly gray. For the second time that day, Daniel couldn't believe what he was seeing. He lost focus on what was around him and panicked when he realized he was about to crash. The seal jumped from the rocks as the boat shortly met them, knocking Daniel unconscious.\nHe woke up staring at a bright florescent light. He could hear his father talking to the doctors and police. Daniel thought it was best to stay quiet. He closed his eyes to wait for the coast to clear. When he opened them again he was on the beach and the seal was standing next to him. It began singing the same beautiful song. Just as Daniel was about to speak, the seal flopped into the ocean, the sky turned from black back to orange and pink, the world resumed around him.\nHe shook his head trying to wake up from this dream but, could not. He screamed and suddenly found himself back in the hospital bed. He lifted his head and asked for water. His father began saying something to him. Unfortunately or for the better, depending on the perspective, Daniel heard none of it. Instead he fell back down into a deep sleep.\nHe awoke on the beach. The breeze was warm against his skin. The seal was standing next to him, singing the same song before flopping into the water. This time, Daniel ran after. He jumped in and reached out to grab its back when SNAP! the seal whipped its tail right into Daniel's ribs.\nHe let out a gasp and suddenly had no air. He jolted towards the surface.\n\"We don't know why he did it, honey.\" his mother offered to his father.\n\"I know you love him. I do too. But, he has got to go to rehab. Someone could have been seriously hurt not to mention how much it's all going to cost to fix all of this. Rehab, or he's out of the house.\" Daniel heard his father reply.\nHe broke through the surface and grimaced in pain. He looked for the shore but it was nowhere to be seen. The seal popped up next to him. It batted its eyes before showing its teeth and dove beneath Daniel. A moment of fear swept over him. He didn't know what to do. He stuck his face into the water to see the seal speeding towards him. WHACK\nDaniel felt his mother's hand holding his as she sat silently next to him. \"Hey, mo-\" Daniel tried before falling back to sleep.\nDaniel was flying through the air just above the water. He saw a trail of blood streaming from his face and the seal keeping pace just after. He looked to the sky and remembered, the dream is his. Rather than landing violently, Daniel slid to a stop on the water's surface before dropping gently beneath it. The seal was viciously streaming right at him. He held out his arm and the seal bit down hard. Only, the teeth didn't break the skin, the skin broke the teeth. Daniel smiled wide and brought them back to the beach.\nHe woke up in the hospital and sat upright. Daniel looked his father in the eye and said \"Rehab sounds great to me.\"",

        "story": "Aphrodite, goddess of lust, lov and beauty, the very image of a blonde model, sat on the dais of Olympus. She was anxiously chewing on her thumbnail, staring down at the Earth below her, \"That...stupid... internet. How could it say Athena's fairer than me? HOW DARE... AND 2 DAYS BEFORE MY HOLIDAY\"\nAthena, goddess of war an intelligence, sporting a crew cut, digicamo, and heads-up-display, was smirking nearby. As gods gained power from the adoration of their followers and interest in their domain, the poll, combined with the tech-flaunting in some recent wars, had given her a boost, and she was literally outshining Aphrodite next to her. \"Oh please, Aphrodite... you can't fight the ebb and flow of time. War always wins out over peace, and greater gods eventually consume the identity of lesser gods. It's only a matter of time until your power becomes mine.\"\nWith this, Athena walked off, laughing haughtily.\nAfter she was gone, Aphrodite screamed out at the top of her voice, \"CUUUPPIIDDDDD!!!\"\nShortly thereafter, her smaller son appeared, looking exhausted, \"It's shortly before Valentine's day... what's so urgent you'd stop our most important time of year?\"\n\"This...poll... why would I, the goddess of beauty, love, and lust, lose out in a contest of fairness, to that... butch.... erarrggg... regardless. Let's cheat the system. I need you to shoot the entire Earth with an arrow. Direct it's love at me.\"\n\"Mom... my power is a splinter of your power. Even you don't have the power to pull that off, what makes you think I would? And if we have to expend our power to get worship your way, it's just going to be diminishing returns. You'll drain yourself dry.\"\n\"What about boosting the levels of lust again? Is there any way I can get any hotter?\"\nCupid shook his head, \"Sorry, but your looks are an amalgam of all the hottest stars. There's really no way to get you to instigate more lust in individuals. You can raise it on an individual level by playing into fetishes, but that'd just turn you off to people who don't have the fetish. I'm sorry, but you're at max capacity.\"\nAphrodite sighed, \"How.... how did this happen? There's got to be something more. How could Athena pass me? I even tried to reduce her power when that poll started by getting all those tech workers fired.\"\n\"I mainly just handle love at first glance, and you've got game, mom. I really don't know. I'm probably not the best to ask. Mind if I get back to work?\"\n\"Sure hun, thanks for the time.\"\nCupid nodded and flew off, leaving Aphrodite to stew. Who to ask? Ask Athena what her secret is? No. Athena was too combative, she'd just take the opportunity to increase her power over her. There was her ex, Hephaestus... he was smart, so he'd probably have an answer. But... no... she had burned that bridge long ago. With her own dalliances.\nIt had been forever since she had actually descended in person to the mortal realm, mostly relying on Cupid and Hermes to keep her up to date. So, she took a step from the dais, disappearing on her step down, appearing in the finish to that step in downtown Seattle. As always, her fashion instantly matched the time period, though she was a little surprised that gone were the robes and flowing garments of the past, and instead she was in some tight denim pants, and a short cotton top with a few strategically placed holes. The earrings were familiar, though.\nShe had to test, though if she still had it. She walked up to a guy, and pointed at him, \"You! Meet me in a nearby hotel for the night of your life!\"\nThe guy looked taken aback, \"Ma'am, I have a husband who I am completely devoted to! And you simply aren't my type!\"\nWith that, he leaned over and kissed the guy next to him. The guy's husband looked back at her, \"Get lost, Karen. This guy's mine.\"\nAphrodite was taken aback. Being turned down wasn't a thing that happened to her often. To be fair, he was gay and she was plenty aware of gay men not being interested in her, for example, there were the Spartans (Oh, dear herself, were they gay.) But she should have picked up on it sooner. Her power was slipping. And what was that he called her? A Karen?\nHer line of thought was interrupted with a short balding guy in a suit tapped her on the shoulder, \"Excuse me, ma'am, you're lovely, and I was wondering if I could get your number.\" It was a common occurrence for men to randomly flirt with her, \"Oh, I'm the number 1 goddess of love.\"\nHe blinked, \"I mean your phone number.\"\n\"Oh, I don't have a cell phone.\" She'd heard about that, never got involved. They didn't seem all that romantic, but if it was a part of modern human flirting, she'd have to learn, \"...but I could think of a reason you might buy me one.\" One dalliance, hotel room, and one night stand later, she had her first, courtesy of a more-than-grateful businessman. If this was part of standard human flirting practices nowadays, she would have to understand it.",

What is happening!!\"\nThe woman's voice became a shrill whisper, like she was scolding a child at church service.\n\"You know exactly what is happening young man, you're wasting their precious time. Do you know how many patients they have to care for every single night? Absolutely disrespectful.\"\nBefore I could reply, a bright flash suddenly blinded me. I opened my eyes and was greeted with the glare of those things again. One extended its hand and stroked my forehead.\n\"Get off me! Let me go!\"\nThe being retracted its hand. It opened its eyes at me again, this time seemingly more stern, and raised a finger to its mouth once more before grabbing my head and holding it still.\nThe whirring sound started up. I screamed.\nOff in the distance I heard a faint but familiar female voice.\n\"Oh, shut up, you baby!\"\nThe whirring became louder and louder, and culminated in a sudden sharp, burning pain in my ear, followed by a rush of cold liquid. I screamed in agony as the thing holding my head down appeared to roll its large black eyes at me.\nFinally, I was released. I could move again. I jerked my body upward to find that they had all vanished from sight. A lone doorway opened at the opposite end of my table in the bright room.\nAs I emerged from the room back onto familiar wet road, I looked behind me. Nothing. As if the room, the ship, whatever it was, never existed. In my hand, I felt a foreign object was now in my grasp. I glanced down to see what I was holding.\nIt was a lollipop.",

My government has agreed to work with you only under the condition that there is as little bloodshed as possible.\"\nSpiegel grinned. \"And just so it will be, Sir. But you have to remember that we are talking about bringing an empire to its knees. I will have to give my special treatment to at least a few cities and army bases. Imagine all the bloodshed there would be, if you had to work with atomic bombs, gas and conventional troops instead.\" He giggled childishly. \"No, Sir, my ways may not be pretty, but they are still more humane than starting a world war.\"\nThe officials turned white. \"So, what you are saying is...these abilities that you have demonstrated...you can do that to entire cities.\"\nSpiegel beamed proudly. \"Of course. Cities, continents, planets. Eventually I will put entire entire star systems through the wringer. But that is still quite a while in the future.\"\n\"...star systems...\" mouthed the official silently.\n\"Sure.\" Spiegel said casually \"What, did you not think that I could see the future? I am able to mangle the space-time-continuum, Sir. I know exactly what the future holds.\"\n\"And what does the future hold?\" asked the official breathlessly.\n\"For your kind? Death, destruction and madness. A lot of that inflicted by my hands. But that really does not matter in the grand scheme of things.\"\nThe official opened a drawer of his desk and retrieved a revolver. \"And what\" he said with a voice that barely rose above a whisper \"What if I shoot you here and now, like a rabid dog?\"\n\"Then I would die here\" said Spiegel \"But at the same time I would walk into an office on the other side of the planet and offer someone to conquer your country for them. You see, I do not care which country will eventually unite the planet and build a space-faring civilization. Only that it is done.\"\nAnd with that he turned around and walked out of the door. The official could hear him whistle why he walked down the corridor.",

He's just protective.\"\n\"Hmmm, no, I don't recall anything in the dating handbook about guys needing to know their girlfriends' exact itineraries\" I answer judgmentally. \"Seriously, next you'll be telling me this dude's tracking your location or something...\"\nAn awkward silence follows, leaving only the hum of the radio.\n\"What the fuck, Margot? Heath's tracking you?!\"\n\"No, it's not like that!\" Margot argues. \"Heath's just paranoid about items getting lost, so he bought some Apple AirTags to put on my stuff\".\nI gasp, shaking the steering wheel.\n\"Margot! Do you have any idea how dangerous that is?!\"\n\"Wh-what's so dangerous about it?\" stammers Margot, her assured resolve slipping.\n\"Anyone can track your AirTags using an iPhone. It's creepy! Your boyfriend or any other rando could've been following us this whole time! How many tags do you have?\"\n\"Um, there's one on my wallet, my keychain, my camera, my suitcase and my jacket.\"\nMy eyes scope the rear-view mirror.\n\"Quick, give them here!\"\nMargot starts gathering the plastic white discs from her possessions. One by one, I frantically pitch the AirTags out the open window into the speeding gravel, each shattering on impact.\nAfter the last one is destroyed, I breathe a sigh of relief and wind the window up.\n\"Sorry, Jane\" Margot apologizes. \"I didn't know all that. Maybe Heath isn't good news after all.\" Yawning, she starts to nod off. \"Thanks for being a good friend. Wake me in Santa Barbara.\"\nAs Margot naps, I turn my gaze from the gorgeous sunset in the windscreen to my sleeping friend-an even more beautiful sight.\nIf only she knew how much I've always loved her. If only she could appreciate women instead of ugly men. Well, she won't have that option any longer.\nWith a smirk, I pluck her still-illuminated phone from her hands and erase its contents, tossing it out the window like the AirTags. By the time we reach the isolated cabin, she'll be too far from civilization to escape.\nAnd her caring, completely harmless boyfriend won't be able to find and rescue her.\nEvery girl needs a BFF.\nBut this girl needs a girlfriend.",

        "story": "The Painter Cat\n\n;\n\nCasey didn't want to take the job but she had to. She needed the money to pay the rent and selling her paintings wasn't covering it. She'd never worked as a maid before. She seldom cleaned her own house but when a woman at the grocery store remarked how badly she needed a housekeeper and was willing to pay, Casey sucked it up and introduced herself, offering her \"services\".\n\n;\n\nThe woman's name was Meredith. She was 77 years old. She had a modest home in a very nice neighborhood and had asked Casey to come twice a week. Casey would be paid 300 a week \u2013 which was pretty good. The first few times were uneventful. Meredith's house was well maintained and the work minimal. All seemed to be going well and then one day Meredith asked Casey to come into the study. She had a gift for her.\n\n;\n\nThe gift was a canvas, brushes and paint. Meredith wanted Casey to paint her. She would be paid 1000 dollars for the painting when it was finished. Casey accepted the offer immediately. Meredith only asked that Casey paint her as if she were 30 years old but wanted to sit as the model. Casey was confused at first. How to take an old woman and paint her as 30 without ever having known what she'd look like at that age. Meredith didn't seem too hung up on details, just told her to paint what she thought. Meredith took a seat on a chair near the window. The direct light defined every wrinkle and crevice in her sagging skin. Casey laid out the supplies and set about painting Meredith as she might have been at 30. It wasn't an easy task.\n\n;\n\nCasey painted the entire day. Meredith prepared them dinner and they resumed again shortly after. It got dark and Casey kept painting. The lamp light softened Meredith's features and Casey found herself enjoying the task and took liberty, creating Meredith as lush and fabulous as the soft golden light made her almost beautiful. By midnight the painting was done. Meredith found it remarkable and was overwhelmed with joy. Casey was about to sign it when Meredith stopped her and asked if she would simply sign it \"Reynaldo\".\n\n;\n\nCasey was confused. She didn't want to sign someone else's name to her work. Meredith insisted and offered no explanation. Casey, tired and confused, grew agitated with the old woman and insisted on signing her name \u2013 which she did. Meredith was so distraught she picked up the brush, set it into the black paint and set about destroying the painting. Casey tried to stop her but Meredith was determined. At last Meredith stepped back, dropped the brush and retreated into her bedroom.\n\n;\n\nCasey knocked on the door and could hear Meredith crying. She finally decided to let herself in. She said she was sorry and asked to be paid. Meredith slowly got up off the bed and went to a drawer where she took out a small box and counted out ten one hundred dollar bills. Casey took the money and left.\n\n;\n\nCasey now had the money she needed for rent and did not return to clean Meredith's house. At the grocery store later that week the manager appeared annoyed with her. When Casey commented, the manager told her that Meredith had paid for a painting and that Casey had argued the directions to sign Reynaldo at the bottom. Casey was furious at the suggestion of allowing anyone else to take advantage of her hard work and talent \u2013 to which the clerk snapped - Reynaldo had been Meredith's beloved cat and was a far better painter than Casey would ever be. He had seen the painting with his own eyes and thought it was a hideous disaster.\n\n;\n\nCasey left, angry. Weeks later she found herself without rent again and no prospects for work so she took up panhandling outside a coffee bar. When she had five dollars she went inside to purchase a bagel for lunch and was amazed to see several portraits of Meredith displayed on the walls, all of them signed \"Reynaldo\".\n\n;\n\nCasey ordered the bagel and remarked on the paintings. She was told they were painted by a cat which belonged to a woman named Meredith who was heir to a whiskey brand fortune.\n\n;\n\nCasey took her bagel and left. She was bummed that she could have peen paid lots of money to paint and that her prideful refusal had left her worse off than she had been in the beginning.",

        "story": "The Painter Cat\n\n;\n\nCasey didn't want to take the job but she had to. She needed the money to pay the rent and selling her paintings wasn't covering it. She'd never worked as a maid before. She seldom cleaned her own house but when a woman at the grocery store remarked how badly she needed a housekeeper and was willing to pay, Casey sucked it up and introduced herself, offering her \"services\".\n\n;\n\nThe woman's name was Meredith. She was 77 years old. She had a modest home in a very nice neighborhood and had asked Casey to come twice a week. Casey would be paid 300 a week \u2013 which was pretty good. The first few times were uneventful. Meredith's house was well maintained and the work minimal. All seemed to be going well and then one day Meredith asked Casey to come into the study. She had a gift for her.\n\n;\n\nThe gift was a canvas, brushes and paint. Meredith wanted Casey to paint her. She would be paid 1000 dollars for the painting when it was finished. Casey accepted the offer immediately. Meredith only asked that Casey paint her as if she were 30 years old but wanted to sit as the model. Casey was confused at first. How to take an old woman and paint her as 30 without ever having known what she'd look like at that age. Meredith didn't seem too hung up on details, just told her to paint what she thought. Meredith took a seat on a chair near the window. The direct light defined every wrinkle and crevice in her sagging skin. Casey laid out the supplies and set about painting Meredith as she might have been at 30. It wasn't an easy task.\n\n;\n\nCasey painted the entire day. Meredith prepared them dinner and they resumed again shortly after. It got dark and Casey kept painting. The lamp light softened Meredith's features and Casey found herself enjoying the task and took liberty, creating Meredith as lush and fabulous as the soft golden light made her almost beautiful. By midnight the painting was done. Meredith found it remarkable and was overwhelmed with joy. Casey was about to sign it when Meredith stopped her and asked if she would simply sign it \"Reynaldo\".\n\n;\n\nCasey was confused. She didn't want to sign someone else's name to her work. Meredith insisted and offered no explanation. Casey, tired and confused, grew agitated with the old woman and insisted on signing her name \u2013 which she did. Meredith was so distraught she picked up the brush, set it into the black paint and set about destroying the painting. Casey tried to stop her but Meredith was determined. At last Meredith stepped back, dropped the brush and retreated into her bedroom.\n\n;\n\nCasey knocked on the door and could hear Meredith crying. She finally decided to let herself in. She said she was sorry and asked to be paid. Meredith slowly got up off the bed and went to a drawer where she took out a small box and counted out ten one hundred dollar bills. Casey took the money and left.\n\n;\n\nCasey now had the money she needed for rent and did not return to clean Meredith's house. At the grocery store later that week the manager appeared annoyed with her. When Casey commented, the manager told her that Meredith had paid for a painting and that Casey had argued the directions to sign Reynaldo at the bottom. Casey was furious at the suggestion of allowing anyone else to take advantage of her hard work and talent \u2013 to which the clerk snapped - Reynaldo had been Meredith's beloved cat and was a far better painter than Casey would ever be. He had seen the painting with his own eyes and thought it was a hideous disaster.\n\n;\n\nCasey left, angry. Weeks later she found herself without rent again and no prospects for work so she took up panhandling outside a coffee bar. When she had five dollars she went inside to purchase a bagel for lunch and was amazed to see several portraits of Meredith displayed on the walls, all of them signed \"Reynaldo\".\n\n;\n\nCasey ordered the bagel and remarked on the paintings. She was told they were painted by a cat which belonged to a woman named Meredith who was heir to a whiskey brand fortune.\n\n;\n\nCasey took her bagel and left. She was bummed that she could have peen paid lots of money to paint and that her prideful refusal had left her worse off than she had been in the beginning.",

        "story": "I've done everything I possibly can over the years. Sometimes just to survive, other times in the hope that it can all come to an end. Everything has been to no avail.\n\nHere I am.\n\nStill.\n\nI'm Hope and I'm 315 years old. I look no older than 16 though. Time has stopped for me, but keeps on passing by for all those around me. Over the years, I have been eaten up by jealously of those that get to grow up, to live their lives and most importantly die as was intended.\n\nI bet you think I'm a vampire, don't you? I wish... I could just step out into the sun to end it all, if that was the case. Maybe a silver bullet could be my way out. Death by Garlic bread would be actually quite an amazing way to go... but no. Not a vampire. My heart beats just like yours, I breathe just like you. My problem is that my father was one of the magistrates during the Salem Witch trials. He was one of those that were responsible for the last death sentences handed out.\n\nI remember being in the court room on that day. I remember Margaret Scott locking eyes with my father after they sentenced to death and saying \"Hope dies last\". I remember the chill tingling up my spine, I remember admiring the woman for not giving up. Strange thing is, I don't remember the moment when I realized that wasn't a last attempt at positivity, but a curse. She cursed my father, with me as the vessel.\n\nThe irony of it? I had argued relentlessly with my father about his part in those diabolical trials. I begged and pleased of him to step down, but apparently it had gone too far and if he did that, there would be questions as to why. It could risk our lives and open our family up for accusations. So he continued. Because of that... Here I am... still...\n\nI always like Margaret and would often sneak her some bread and cheese. She had been left destitute following the death of her husband. It's not like nowadays where there is some level of support in place, granted not the best, but so much better than it used to be 'back in the day'. That makes me sad. A person that I always found pleasant cursed me to this life.\n\nI was so distraught at my father's involvement in ther trials that I left that night, never to return to Salem until last year.  I don't know what brought me back.  I could barely fight it, so decided to 'go with the flow'... And here I am, living in the same house as I did back then.  Granted, it's changed now.  And the house has been split up into tiny apartments and by some coincidence I am in the part of the house that used to be my bedroom. \n\nMy inability to age must sound like a dream. But I can assure you it's not. Imagine being 16 forever. Not being old-looking enough to be an adult certainly makes it difficult to do much of anything - I can only ever get menial jobs, live in dodgy areas, because that's what I can afford with my wages. I can't stay in an area more than a few years because questions start to raise. After over 300 years of working I am exhausted and must have earned a nice pension many times over. I've never been sick in the past \u2013 not even a cold. I wish for a terminal disease, surely cancer can beat me?  Maybe I need to find that glitch in the 'system'.... who knows...\n\nWith every war, every pandemic I have held onto the Hope that the end of the world is nigh. Unfortunately, us humans are a resilient bunch \u2013 we're not going anywhere any time soon.\n\nAs morbid as it is, I have a list on me of all female infants and young girls that have passed away in any area I live in, collected from cemeteries and obituaries so that I can steal their identities, their social security numbers and so forth. I feel dirty every time I do it, but if I can't die, I need to survive. \n\nNext on my list is a little baby girl, who died 16 years ago. Hope Elizabeth Scott.... Happens to be my name, well apart from the surname...  A coincidence that she shares her surname with poor Margaret? Her whole family perished in a fire in my old neighbourhood in Salem. She fought for weeks in ICU, before passing. With her death, came the end of her family's linage.\n\nI've been in touch with a questionable type who will get me all my paperwork in place. This time it feels different. Is it a coincidence? Or maybe this is my way out?\n\nMaybe Hope does die last after all...",

        "story": "My mom is old. Her vibrance gone. Bones brittle. Hair gray. Eyes glazed over from cataracts. Her skin patchworked with blood spots. And it is not clich\u00e9 to say it happened overnight. Just three years ago she was getting a monthly pedicure and keeping hair appointments to cut and color her once brown hair. With her five children grown and gone, she never stayed home. From the time she woke until dinner time, she was outside roaming in her car visiting friends and shopping. She was alive and loving every minute of her new freedom that was formerly restricted from being a full-time nurse, a housewife, and a mother.\n\nThen the accident changed everything. Three years ago she stepped off a sidewalk curb and lost her balance. Her right shoulder completely shattered, and it was how she discovered she had osteoporosis.  The entire shoulder had to be replaced. The surgeon picked out pieces of splintered bones and put in a round metal ball to give her about sixty percent use of her shoulder again. She suffered through the year long process and fell again, this time breaking a bone in her back and knee.  For the last few years, her car has been supplanted with a recliner.\n\nThe last few Christmas holidays have obviously not been the same. This one, however, will probably be the last. A few months ago I started to notice the memory problems. I visit her weekly and since the Breaking of Bones I have been spending every Saturday morning and night with her by sleeping in my old childhood room. The severity of the memory problems became more noticeable every week I returned. \n\nFor the first time since I was born, my mom forgot my birthday. Birthdays are more important to no one other than a mother\u2013at least, my mother. Birthdays were an event celebrated in my parents' home more than Christmas. My birthday, my brother's birthday, and my father's birthday are all in December. My mom forgot all three. No phone calls. No cards. No cake. No celebrations. We did not remind her. We only spoke of it amongst ourselves briefly to mention that we noticed. Maybe it did not need to be broached. More than likely, we were so saddened about the Great Forgetting that none of us could bring ourselves to discuss it. \n\nLast Thursday, just four days before Christmas, my mother told me when she was a teenager that she would eat the honeycombs from real bee honey. She said it was her favorite thing to eat as a child. She and her two sisters would sit on the porch and put the comb on an English muffin or biscuits. She said she would not eat oatmeal unless she had honeycomb pieces to put in it. Sometimes she would just suck on the honeycomb before finally eating it by itself. She and her two sisters felt rich if they had it. \"Honeycomb was not easy to come by in those days,\" she said. \"I can't remember what it tasted like but it was the best kind of candy. I wish I could taste it again.\"\n\nIt is said that men have trouble listening to women.  I had no trouble listening to my mom. I knew what her Christmas gift was going to be this year. I got Mom six separate quarts of honey with combs in them. I had to go to three different bee apiaries in two different states to get them. I spent no fewer than two days tracking down and purchasing honeycomb. (Apparently it is not a popular request with bee farmers.) The price was costly but would be worth it. It would be the best gift I have ever given my mom. \n\nThis year will be doubly special for me because I know this will be my mom's last Christmas. Her memory problem is exacerbating too quickly. The differences are noticeable now almost daily. But I had a secret I could not tell her for two more days until Christmas morning. Why can it not be Christmas Day right now so I can give her this gift right now! This is going to be her best Christmas. I am certain of it. I am going to drop a hint about her gift like she used to do with me as a child a few days before Christmas. Yesterday, while I was sitting on Mom's couch with her across me in her recliner, I asked, \"Mom, do you remember when you used to eat honeycombs on the porch with Pat and Dina?\"  She turned her head to face me with a blank stare. \n\n\"Honeycombs?\" She asked. \"Who told you that? No, I never ate honeycombs. Those things were gross.\"",

She said she would not eat oatmeal unless she had honeycomb pieces to put in it. Sometimes she would just suck on the honeycomb before finally eating it by itself.

        "story": "I shit you not, my skin is crawling just thinking about typing this to you all. I've never told anyone what happened until now\n\nWhen I was 13 I used to play video games in my parents basement all the time. It was finished and heated. I spent more time down there than my room. I would describe my basement as having an \"L\" shape. I played video games with a tv at the far wall in the long main part and there was a fridge around the back corner in the shorter part (behind me while playing).\n\nOne day I'm home alone after school playing Halo 3 with Turtle Beach headphones on. They are the type of headphones that play sound through them. So in other words, you really can't hear anything going on in the real world around you until you take them off. So I'm playing and I hear this loud bang from behind me. Loud enough for me to hear through the game sounds. I immediately rip my headphones off and whip around to look behind me. I see nothing. I call out, \"Mom?\", to see if she's home. She wasn't. So I get up slowly, I'm mildly confused, not scared at this point. I walk around the far corner to where the fridge is and I see this glass beer mug on the floor about 3 feet from the fridge. \n\nLet me paint this picture for you. On top of the fridge my dad had an organized display. There was a neon beer sign in the center with two identical decorative beer mugs symmetrically placed on each side of the sign. This display sits about 5 feet off the ground. \n\nWhen I turned the corner and saw the mug on the ground I got an eerie feeling that seemed to have no source. I thought; damn, how did that mug get so far away from the fridge, it must have bounced when it fell. I couldn't believe it didn't break. I hesitated for a brief moment simply confused, then picked up the mug and placed it back to the left side of the neon sign. I shrugged it off as weird and went back to my gaming.\n\nOne week later. \n\nI'm again playing halo with turtle beach headphones on, loud as fuck. I'm home alone after school. BANG! CLINK! CLINK! There was no question in my mind that it was the same noise I'd heard the week prior. I ripped my headphones off. Chills ran from my head to my toes. I was petrified. I was scared to look behind me. I slowly turned around. I stared backwards into the darkness wide-eyed for what felt like minutes before I built the courage to investigate knowing I was home alone. My heart was pounding. I couldn't just sit there, I was trapped with my back against the wall, literally. I hesitantly and slowly crept towards the other end of the basement slowly rounding the corner, fearful of what I might see; my mind was racing. There it was, the same mug on the ground, but this time it was farther from the fridge, maybe 5 feet away. I was fucking terrified. I sprinted towards my tv, shut my game off and ran upstairs. As I bolted up the stairs two at a time, I couldn't help but feel something watching from behind me. I didn't go back down into the basement for the rest of the day.\n\nThe next morning I headed downstairs to play video games like usual, briefly forgetting what had happened the day before. I turned the lights on and saw the mug on the ground where It had been left yesterday. I thought, \"whatever, there must be some explanation\". So I grabbed the mug and walked over to the fridge to put it back. There was an additional overhead light in that area of the basement. I flicked in on so I could see better and investigate/try to find some explanation. I noticed that the top of the fridge was pretty level, so it wouldn't have slipped off by itself. And the mugs were placed in the center on the top, so it didn't make sense for it to have fallen on its own, like at all. Plus the other mug had never moved. Then I saw it... there was a perfect circular outline of where the mug had been sitting. The outline was formed by a thin, surrounding layer of evenly settled dust that covered the entire fridge top. The dust was everywhere except where the mug had been... it hadn't fallen... It hadn't slid off... It had been picked straight up and then thrown. \n\nAt that moment of realization, I felt chills like never before. The fear consumed my entire body. \n\nThis is all 100% true. On both occasions I was the only one home, trust me, I checked",

        "story": "I shit you not, my skin is crawling just thinking about typing this to you all. I've never told anyone what happened until now\n\nWhen I was 13 I used to play video games in my parents basement all the time. It was finished and heated. I spent more time down there than my room. I would describe my basement as having an \"L\" shape. I played video games with a tv at the far wall in the long main part and there was a fridge around the back corner in the shorter part (behind me while playing).\n\nOne day I'm home alone after school playing Halo 3 with Turtle Beach headphones on. They are the type of headphones that play sound through them. So in other words, you really can't hear anything going on in the real world around you until you take them off. So I'm playing and I hear this loud bang from behind me. Loud enough for me to hear through the game sounds. I immediately rip my headphones off and whip around to look behind me. I see nothing. I call out, \"Mom?\", to see if she's home. She wasn't. So I get up slowly, I'm mildly confused, not scared at this point. I walk around the far corner to where the fridge is and I see this glass beer mug on the floor about 3 feet from the fridge. \n\nLet me paint this picture for you. On top of the fridge my dad had an organized display. There was a neon beer sign in the center with two identical decorative beer mugs symmetrically placed on each side of the sign. This display sits about 5 feet off the ground. \n\nWhen I turned the corner and saw the mug on the ground I got an eerie feeling that seemed to have no source. I thought; damn, how did that mug get so far away from the fridge, it must have bounced when it fell. I couldn't believe it didn't break. I hesitated for a brief moment simply confused, then picked up the mug and placed it back to the left side of the neon sign. I shrugged it off as weird and went back to my gaming.\n\nOne week later. \n\nI'm again playing halo with turtle beach headphones on, loud as fuck. I'm home alone after school. BANG! CLINK! CLINK! There was no question in my mind that it was the same noise I'd heard the week prior. I ripped my headphones off. Chills ran from my head to my toes. I was petrified. I was scared to look behind me. I slowly turned around. I stared backwards into the darkness wide-eyed for what felt like minutes before I built the courage to investigate knowing I was home alone. My heart was pounding. I couldn't just sit there, I was trapped with my back against the wall, literally. I hesitantly and slowly crept towards the other end of the basement slowly rounding the corner, fearful of what I might see; my mind was racing. There it was, the same mug on the ground, but this time it was farther from the fridge, maybe 5 feet away. I was fucking terrified. I sprinted towards my tv, shut my game off and ran upstairs. As I bolted up the stairs two at a time, I couldn't help but feel something watching from behind me. I didn't go back down into the basement for the rest of the day.\n\nThe next morning I headed downstairs to play video games like usual, briefly forgetting what had happened the day before. I turned the lights on and saw the mug on the ground where It had been left yesterday. I thought, \"whatever, there must be some explanation\". So I grabbed the mug and walked over to the fridge to put it back. There was an additional overhead light in that area of the basement. I flicked in on so I could see better and investigate/try to find some explanation. I noticed that the top of the fridge was pretty level, so it wouldn't have slipped off by itself. And the mugs were placed in the center on the top, so it didn't make sense for it to have fallen on its own, like at all. Plus the other mug had never moved. Then I saw it... there was a perfect circular outline of where the mug had been sitting. The outline was formed by a thin, surrounding layer of evenly settled dust that covered the entire fridge top. The dust was everywhere except where the mug had been... it hadn't fallen... It hadn't slid off... It had been picked straight up and then thrown. \n\nAt that moment of realization, I felt chills like never before. The fear consumed my entire body. \n\nThis is all 100% true. On both occasions I was the only one home, trust me, I checked",

They're everywhere I am, their voices echoing against my skull.\n\nYou might think it's a gift, but in reality, being able to see and hear the dead is nothing but a curse. I can do nothing for them, not one shred of solace I can offer while their voices pound away in my brain.\n\nWhen I was younger, I thought it was fun. Like a game that only I could play. Watching their ghostly wanderings, chasing the smallest ones through the garden of my childhood home. They have always seemed more real to me that even my own family. But now, the game has become dark and twisted.\n\nOne day, I was walking down the street when I heard the most gut-wrenching screams I'd ever borne witness to. Looking around, I quickly located the source: the shadow of an old man standing next to park bench. A mangy stray dog was curled up on the rough planks of wood, shivering in the chilly air. The ghost reached out to it futilely, empty tears streaming down his face as he failed to comfort his lost friend.\n\nI couldn't take it anymore.

I would occasionally see patients sitting outside with beautiful nurses, everyone looking peaceful and serene. The perfect place for someone like me.\n\nI stepped through the front door and up to the front desk. A lovely woman with ebony skin and a heart-shaped face smiled from behind stacks of papers.\n\n\"Hello,\" she greeted me warmly. \"How can I help you?\"\n\n\"I need to check myself in,\" I replied.

I dropped my head into my hands. \"I just want them to leave me alone so I can rest.\"\n\nAs gleaming tears began to form in my eyes, the doctor leaned forward and placed her soft hand on mine.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" she said with a gentle smile. \"I'll keep the ghosts from bothering you.\"\n\nDays went by in a haze. Sometimes I walked outside among the weeping willow trees, accompanied by a nurse with rubina lips or gleaming almond eyes.

I have a lifetime of rest to catch up on.\n\nBut now, from somewhere just outside the wispy fog of sleep, I feel someone shaking me, voices talking and shattering the blissful silence.\n\n\"Wake up,\" a stern voice says.\n\nI barely have the energy to mumble, \"I'm just trying to rest.\"\n\n\"You can't stay here,\" he says angrily.\n\nI blink open my eyes slowly, taking in the shining gold police badge pinned to his shirt.\n\n\"But I'm a patient here,\" I say, rubbing the sandman's dust from my tired eyes.\n\nThe officer shakes his head in pity. \"You can't be a patient here,\" he says roughly. \"This hospital's been closed for years.\"\n\nThe silence explodes, and I twist in the air as I fall.",

He hardly thought anything of anything I did...It didn't concern me too much until a particularly large bird started squawking outside while my window was open. My cousin's house is in a forest and this type of thing was common, but that day I couldn't handle it. I covered my ears as the bird continued squawking.  \n***Noise, noise, noise!***  \nI pressed on my ears harder as the bird continued it's infernal squawking.  \n***NOISE, NOISE, NOISE!***  \nI couldn't take it any longer. At an inhuman speed, I jumped out of my window and ran up to the infernal bird. It squawked loud as I caught it's tail feathers, which didn't help it.I killed it. With my hands. I squeezed it really tight around the stomach with my left hand and pulled out it's tail feather with my right so it couldn't run away. It continued to sqwauk, making me even angrier. ***NOISE, NOISE, NOISE!*** Eventually I crushed it's bones and it fell dead in my hands. I made a half-hearted attempt to dispose of it, taking it a little ways into the woods, but that's all I did other than washing my arms off(after maybe licking my palms a bit). The weird thing is...I wasn't scared. I was a little surprised at myself, but I wasn't scared. It just felt so...*natural* when I killed that bird. I hadn't really been into horror and gore before, but I hadn't really been squeamish about it, just no strong feelings at all. But killing that bird...just felt right.\n\nA few hours later I was sitting at the table with my cousin everything was fine until the kitchen phone went off. I *lost it.* I practically tore it out of the wall. \"Sarah, what the hell?!\" He yelled. Yelled. He yelled a lot, but that day was different. \"Loud noise...\" I growled. \"The phone rings every damn day!

I mentioned it to our dad when we were about eight, but he said it was nothing to worry about.But it seemed like he was lying.Once when I was ten I saw my aunt take a small amount of food and some water into the basement late at night, which was strictly off limits to me and my brother, though it was never said aloud.

        "story": "My twin brother Lance and I never really liked our aunt's house. She always seemed so creepy there, like she was hiding something. She also looked a little creepy and had some features I know she hadn't been born with. She almost looked like a mother, despite having no children and never having any or even a husband or boyfriend at all.  I mentioned it to our dad when we were about eight, but he said it was nothing to worry about.But it seemed like he was lying.Once when I was ten I saw my aunt take a small amount of food and some water into the basement late at night, which was strictly off limits to me and my brother, though it was never said aloud. It was locked at all times. *\"Why would she eat it in there?\"* I thought. I shared it with Lance but no one else. When we were fourteen, Lance and I went to the basement door late at night, when our parents and aunt were out. We were supposed to be asleep and they had taken our phones and the tv remotes with them, so we decided to play a game with the door, which the material was good for. One of us would do a pattern of knocking and the other would try to match it. Lame, but we figured we couldn't get any more bored than we already were, and we still didn't want to go to sleep. After about a minute of playing, something happened. Before I could answer lance's knock,someone else did.It had come from the basement, though further down, not at the door. But we could hear it clearly. \"Okay, that is it!\" Lance said, removing the pin that keeps his bangs out of his face. \"What do you mean?!\" I asked. He pushed me out of the way and started to pick the lock. \"We can't wait for mom and dad to get back, I'm unlocking this door NOW!\" He said.  \nWe were down in the basement with our flashlights, looking to see who had knocked back. We were both scared and determined. Then my flashlight turn on something that terrified me.\n\nShe looked about seventeen, and so much like me and Lance. She had long hair that almost touched the floor and slightly obscured her face, and it was black like mine and Lance's. She had the same pale skin as us and the same light smattering of dark freckles as us. Her clothes looked like she hadn't had new ones since ten. She looked so scared but relived to see us at the same time. She looked so much like my aunt. I didn't learn until later why she was put down there, but I already knew one thing in that moment.\n\nThis was my cousin.",

It knew that it did not have much time left. \nThe season had been dry and other, bigger trees in the forest had used up most of the nutrients and moisture that were still left in the soil around it. \nIt was still a thin and small trunk with only few branches and shallow roots. It lacked the resources to compete with the bigger trees around it. \nWhat use would it be to struggle against that already decided fate? Every day was just one day closer to the inevitable end. \nBut one day a stranger came to the forest. \nA human. \nThe tree did not know humans well. They rarely visited its part of the forest. On the rare occasions one found their way here they did not stay long. \nThis day too the tree expected the human to leave after a brief look around. \nBut that is not what happened. \nWith wide eyes full of wonder the human took in the vibrant environment. It seemed to be fascinated by all the trees and flowers that grew here. \nAnd then the human's gaze fell onto the dying tree. With browning, too dry leaves and in some places almost naked twigs and branches it was not pretty to look at. \nThe tree was sure the human would soon point its attention to the prettier and healthier plants around it. \nInstead the human stepped forward and touched one of its dried out branches with gentle fingers. It took out some kind of container from its pouch and slowly started pouring the liquid from it on the dry soil around the dying tree. \nWater. \nThe human had given it water.\nThe tree soaked it up as fast as it could. It wasn't quite enough but it was more than it had gotten in what felt like a long time. \nA fighting chance. Hope. \nThe container was empty now and the human put it back in its pouch. It looked reluctant. Then the human made some noises that the tree did not understand and left. \nIt was a short encounter, but it had fed the tree's dying flame of hope a little. The water had not been much, but it was enough to tide it over for just a bit longer. \nIt had a chance now. \nAnd unexpectedly the human visited again. And again and again. \nEach time bringing water with it and one time even some fresh, rich soil that it put around the tree. \nWith the human's help the previously dying tree began to flourish. On the outside not much difference could be seen yet but the changes were happening. The tree had fanned out its roots. It was growing them deeper every day in order to have a stable base for the future, with better access to the nutrients deep inside the earth. \nIt was also growing little buds, where flowers would bloom in time. There weren't many yet, but they gave hope for the future. \nOne bud was almost ready to bloom. It was hidden behind some leafs though so it wasn't directly visible. \nOne day the human came by again but didn't act like it normally did. \nThe human sat down on the ground with their arms slung tightly around themselves. \nWater started leaking from their eyes and desperate noises escaped their throat. \nIt sat there like that for a long time. \nThe tree did not know what was wrong with this human. It did not understand the behaviour the human was showing right now. But the tree knew one thing. \nIt wanted to do something for this human that had done so much for it. \nWith much effort it rustled some of its leaves. Some of them fell to the ground in front of the human. \nThe human looked up startled by the sudden noise. \nA beautiful, vibrant flower bloomed, no longer hidden by leafs. The tree had poured all the resources it could muster at that moment into that flower. This flower was all it had to give. \nThe humans eyes grew wide and the water stopped leaking from them. A big smile formed on the human's face. With gentle hands it touched the vibrant flower, careful not to accidentally damage it. \n\"Thank you\"\nEven though the tree could not understand the human language it understood the message the tried to convey. \nThe flower was the tree's thank you and the human had understood.\nSometimes with just a little help life found a way to persevere.

        "story": "For as long as I can remember, this city has tormented me. A paradise to all outside of it and a prison for all who inhabit it. I held the gun in my hand, my final possession worthy of keeping. This city... has taken everything from me. A member of the law, a beautiful family, a peaceful life that was more than anyone could ask for.\n\nTaken.\n\nThe noisy clubs and neon lights deafen and blind everyone from the rotten core I've dealt with day in and day out. The red lights hide the blood on my hands. Sirens wail in the distance. No matter how steaming hot this night got, this rooftop filled with bodies felt colder than the deepest crypt. All I could do was sit there by the concrete ledge, facing the doorway holding the stairs, waiting for shadows to dance maniacally before me as the bite on my shoulder felt like a blowtorch breathed down my neck.\n\nI saw the others get bit. I saw my family get bit. I saw what they turned into. It was hard to fight off the call of sleep coursing through my veins from the wound.

        "story": "Kyle and his parents recently bought a vacation home in South Jersey. \n\nSince Kyle was an only child, he decided he'd take a walk around his new beach town and meet new people. He was sixteen so his parents didn't care that he wondered off by himself. \n\nAfter exploring the town for the day, it was getting dark and Kyle decided he wanted to take a walk on the beach before he headed in for the night. \n\nHe walked along the tide. The beach before him was empty because it was late October and tourist season was long gone. That's why Kyle was shocked to see another person about twenty yards ahead of him, walking toward him. \n\nEven from this distance, he could make out that it was girl around his age walking his direction. And even from here, he could tell she was good looking. \n\nShe was now only ten yards away. Kyle slicked back his hair and went up to her. \n\n\"How ya doing\" Kyle asked. \nThe girl was pale, with long blonde hair and brown eyes. She almost didn't seem real, that's how pale she was. But she had a charming smile and a slim figure. \n\n\"I'm doing fine, just taking my normal stroll on the beach\", she said. \n\nThey chatted for awhile. He found out her name was Elizabeth Wilson and she also lived in town with her family. She was friendly but there was something mysterious about her. Kyle didn't know what but he was curious about her. \n\n\"Listen it's getting late\", Kyle said, acknowledging the moonlight reflecting off the ocean. \"Can I get your number? We'll get dinner sometime.\" Kyle said. \n\nElizabeth's eyes started to water, she sniffled as if she was about to cry. \n\n\"I'm sorry if that's too forward,\" Kyle tried to explain, wondering why she was suddenly so upset. \n\n\"I can't\" she said. Her eyes were wide and longing. She looked as if she wanted to say something else but didn't. \"I can only give you this.\" \n\nShe suddenly planted her lips on his and they shared a deep kiss. Kyle breathed deeply. He could smell the ocean and sand on her. He was about to pull her closer when Elizabeth pulled away. She looked at him, deep in his eyes and then sprinted away. \n\nStunned Kyle shouted. \"Hey wait, come back.\" \nBut it was too dark to see exactly where she ran off too. Kyle held his fingers to his lips, he could feel her kiss on lips, and he tasted salt. Ocean salt. \n \nConfused at what happened, Kyle made the walk back to his new house and went to bed. \n\nThe next morning he woke up, and immediately went out in town again. He wanted to find Elizabeth and find out what that was all about. He looked all around town and the beach but could not find her. \n\nDisappointed and still confused he sat alone in the sand, wondering about Elizabeth. \n\n\"You okay kid?\" A voice from behind him said. \nKyle spun around and saw a man in mid fifties walking toward him. \n\n\"Yeah I'm fine\" Kyle said, looking at the crashing waves before him. \n\"I saw you walking up and down the beach like you were on a mission to find somebody, any way I can help?\" The man said. He was now standing next to him, also admiring the ocean as the sun began to set. \n\nKyle thought maybe this guy would know Elizabeth, it was a small town after all. \n\n\"Well,\" Kyle began, \"I'm looking for a\" he didn't know what word to use. \"I'm looking for a friend,\" he decided to say. \"Her names Elizabeth. Elizabeth Wilson.\"\n\nKyle looked at the man expectantly, hoping he had some piece of information of who she is or where he might find her. \n\nThe man turned to face Kyle completely. \"Did you say, Elizabeth Wilson?\"\nKyle nodded yes. \n\nThe mans face grew serious in the sinking sun. \n\n\"What does she look like?\" The man asked.\n\"Pale, blonde hair, brown eyes, around my age, cute,\" Kyle answered. \n\nThe man looked questioning my into Kyle's eyes. \"You playing some kind of prank?\"\n\n\"No,\" Kyle answered. \"Not at all, I- \"\n\nBut the man cut him off. \"The Wilson's used to live two doors down from me.\" The man said, hitchhiking his thumb over his shoulder. \n\n\"But They moved about ten years ago,\" the man continued. \"Tragic what happened. Their daughter, Elizabeth went night swimming around this time of year, and she drowned. And they never found her body.\"\n\nKyle looked at the man in horror as realization dawned on him.

        "story": "Kyle and his parents recently bought a vacation home in South Jersey. \n\nSince Kyle was an only child, he decided he'd take a walk around his new beach town and meet new people. He was sixteen so his parents didn't care that he wondered off by himself. \n\nAfter exploring the town for the day, it was getting dark and Kyle decided he wanted to take a walk on the beach before he headed in for the night. \n\nHe walked along the tide. The beach before him was empty because it was late October and tourist season was long gone. That's why Kyle was shocked to see another person about twenty yards ahead of him, walking toward him. \n\nEven from this distance, he could make out that it was girl around his age walking his direction. And even from here, he could tell she was good looking. \n\nShe was now only ten yards away. Kyle slicked back his hair and went up to her. \n\n\"How ya doing\" Kyle asked. \nThe girl was pale, with long blonde hair and brown eyes. She almost didn't seem real, that's how pale she was. But she had a charming smile and a slim figure. \n\n\"I'm doing fine, just taking my normal stroll on the beach\", she said. \n\nThey chatted for awhile. He found out her name was Elizabeth Wilson and she also lived in town with her family. She was friendly but there was something mysterious about her. Kyle didn't know what but he was curious about her. \n\n\"Listen it's getting late\", Kyle said, acknowledging the moonlight reflecting off the ocean. \"Can I get your number? We'll get dinner sometime.\" Kyle said. \n\nElizabeth's eyes started to water, she sniffled as if she was about to cry. \n\n\"I'm sorry if that's too forward,\" Kyle tried to explain, wondering why she was suddenly so upset. \n\n\"I can't\" she said. Her eyes were wide and longing. She looked as if she wanted to say something else but didn't. \"I can only give you this.\" \n\nShe suddenly planted her lips on his and they shared a deep kiss. Kyle breathed deeply. He could smell the ocean and sand on her. He was about to pull her closer when Elizabeth pulled away. She looked at him, deep in his eyes and then sprinted away. \n\nStunned Kyle shouted. \"Hey wait, come back.\" \nBut it was too dark to see exactly where she ran off too. Kyle held his fingers to his lips, he could feel her kiss on lips, and he tasted salt. Ocean salt. \n \nConfused at what happened, Kyle made the walk back to his new house and went to bed. \n\nThe next morning he woke up, and immediately went out in town again. He wanted to find Elizabeth and find out what that was all about. He looked all around town and the beach but could not find her. \n\nDisappointed and still confused he sat alone in the sand, wondering about Elizabeth. \n\n\"You okay kid?\" A voice from behind him said. \nKyle spun around and saw a man in mid fifties walking toward him. \n\n\"Yeah I'm fine\" Kyle said, looking at the crashing waves before him. \n\"I saw you walking up and down the beach like you were on a mission to find somebody, any way I can help?\" The man said. He was now standing next to him, also admiring the ocean as the sun began to set. \n\nKyle thought maybe this guy would know Elizabeth, it was a small town after all. \n\n\"Well,\" Kyle began, \"I'm looking for a\" he didn't know what word to use. \"I'm looking for a friend,\" he decided to say. \"Her names Elizabeth. Elizabeth Wilson.\"\n\nKyle looked at the man expectantly, hoping he had some piece of information of who she is or where he might find her. \n\nThe man turned to face Kyle completely. \"Did you say, Elizabeth Wilson?\"\nKyle nodded yes. \n\nThe mans face grew serious in the sinking sun. \n\n\"What does she look like?\" The man asked.\n\"Pale, blonde hair, brown eyes, around my age, cute,\" Kyle answered. \n\nThe man looked questioning my into Kyle's eyes. \"You playing some kind of prank?\"\n\n\"No,\" Kyle answered. \"Not at all, I- \"\n\nBut the man cut him off. \"The Wilson's used to live two doors down from me.\" The man said, hitchhiking his thumb over his shoulder. \n\n\"But They moved about ten years ago,\" the man continued. \"Tragic what happened. Their daughter, Elizabeth went night swimming around this time of year, and she drowned. And they never found her body.\"\n\nKyle looked at the man in horror as realization dawned on him. Kyle hadn't kissed Elizabeth, he had kissed her ghost.",

As he had been often told, he lacked charm, looks or even that oft used fallback of a winning personality. Here she was however, dancing up against him. So close he could smell her perfume, he didn't recognise it but something in it drove him wild. The woman's slim frame and short dress certainly helped that too. She'd walked up to him, whispered in his ear in a voice like the sweetest honey that she liked his smile. That he had nice teeth. \n\nNothing else but inappropriate looks had been exchanged between them since then. She never opened her mouth. She hadn't spoken since they met and only appeared to breathe through her nose. On top of that her cheeks and lips seemed to bulge out slightly, like she was holding her breath. Then she pulled her top down a little further and those little details were lost to the back of his one track mind. \n\nToby took one last swig of the drink she had given him before hurling the bottle into the crowd behind him. In a voice far more slurred than confident he shouted over the din of the music \"So uh do you wanna get out of this dump? Your place or...\". The woman cut him off with a finger to his lips and a coy smile. \"My place then?\" he stammered, not having expected that to work. She nodded, took his hand and leads him out of the nightclub into the cool air. \n\nAs soon as they turned the corner from the nightclub, Toby seized the tiny blonde's shoulder and pushed her up against the wall. \"So how about a kiss?\" he slurred, leaning his face into hers. In response the woman placed one finger on his chest and pushed him back with ease. Then there was that coy smile again, lips never parting, before she took his hand and leads him on towards his house. That small part of his brain screamed out again. It tried warning the rest of him that a woman that small could not be that strong. That she was leading him straight to his house. Toby had never been the smartest man though and awash in alcohol the rest of his brain ignored the warning.   \n\nBefore he knew it he was at his door, the woman hanging off his arm softly giggled as he fiddled with his keys. His numb fingers dropped them, cursing he went to pick them up. Before he could the woman reached down, daintily gathered them up and walked past him to the door. Within a mere moment the door clicked and swung open. Toby stumbled past the woman into the hallway. He turned to see her stood right on the threshold, a forlorn look on her face. Irritated he blurted out \"well come on in then you dozy mare!\" Despite the unpleasant tone, she smiled at this, eyes agleam and stepped through the threshold. She pointed for Toby to head upstairs before turning and locking the door. Once she had snapped the key off in the lock, she followed Toby upstairs into the gloom. \n\nToby struggled furiously to get his trousers off. All he had managed however, was to get them tangled around his ankles. Before he could free himself, a short sharp shove sent him sprawling onto the bed. He scrambled onto his back in time to see the blonde climb onto the bed with him. She straddled his chest, placed a hand on each of his shoulders and pinned him to the bed. The crushing pain her hands were causing was immediately blocked out by her smile.

        "story": "Once upon a time there was a dog. The dogs name was Rover, and the story is over. \n\nBe glad that is not our story, for you see, our story also starts with a dog. A little dog and a little girl.\n\nEver since he could remember he was on the streets. He didn't remember much from his puppy years- only faint impressions of family and warmth remained in the deepest recesses of his memory. Cold winds and frigid rain devoured everything in their path- but he was safe... in a ramshackle cardboard box. \n\nHe was safe in his little corner of alley, ignored by the hurried people with sharp voices and pounding footsteps. He didn't like people. Not those people anyway. When all he could see were their dangerous shoes and loping limbs, ignorant of an entire world of street dogs and cats that are eating street rats. \n\nThey rushed away from the rain, business suits, raggedy coats and anything in between, empty streets they said- blind to life in between. In between meals, homes and danger, the only things as constant to him as his tail, the promise of a meal with the little girl and his name. \n\n\"See you tomorrow!\" Echoes in his ears again.

        "story": "The myth of Dragons have been greatly misrepresented over the years. The first falsehood being that they were in fact a myth, the second being that they were large and terrifying reptiles set on destroying mankind.\n\nA dragon's size was directly proportionate to the size of it's gold hoard, but no dragon has ever gotten more than one or two coins. There are rumors that Mr. Chinue at the top of the hill has a large dragon, protecting his large pile of gold, but personally I just think they're rumors. Shop keepers especially, are good about keeping the dragon coins away from the non-dragon coins.\n\nThat was another falsehood, Dragons don't care who owns the coin, as long as they travel with it. Most people when they go shopping, take their little coin purse complete with a dragon. The tricky part is making sure to trade the entirety of the Dragon's hoard, as not to upset the dragon. Some people have to pay for a tiny loaf of bread with a whole gold coin just to keep the dragon happy. You can't split it up, which is why most dragons only have small hoards.\n\nIt really is a pain when you're looking to buy and the shop keeper doesn't have a dragon hoard the correct size to give you proper change. Sometimes you get lucky and get a little more back, but more often than not you get shorted change. This is just an expectation now when you go shopping.\n\nTaking a dragon from it's hoard can be dangerous, it's not going to burn down a village but you might lose a finger, and the dragon will ALWAYS find it's way back to its hoard.\n\nWhich is actually my current problem right now. See, I just learned all of this about dragons today. Like 5 minutes ago in fact. Dragons aren't common in the western province where I am from, but here in the eastern province? They're everywhere!\n\nSo when I spent my gold coin earlier, I got 3 silver coins and a tiny dragon back in change. Then when I saw a jacket, I spent 2 of my silver coins. Unfortunately unaware of the consequences that would follow this action.\n\nYou see, my dragon was sleeping when I had spent his coins. It wasn't until later, when I was on my way back to the Western province, that I heard the high pitched wail from inside my coin purse.\n\nConfused by the sound of distress, I peaked in and immediately got a tiny green dragon attached to my nose.\n\nWith a startled yelp, I swiped at my face sending the dragon tumbling towards the ground. With a high pitched battle cry, the small reptile flung itself back at me and attached itself to my shoulder.\n\nOne second it was fine, sure it's claws dug a little deep into my brand new coat, but it had seemed to calm down. The next second a high pitched cry was released from it's mouth, directly into my ear.\n\nThis cry went on for 10 minutes before I tried to bribe the creature.\n\n\"Here dragon,\" I tsk'd lightly, holding up a gold coin. \"I'm sorry I gave away your silver coins but you can have this one!\"\n\nThe high pitched squeal didn't stop.\n\nEventually on the road I met a couple travelers who were all too happy to trade me 3 silver coins for my gold coin. A complete rip off if you asked me, but I was desperate.\n\nHolding the coins out to the dragon as a peace offering, the cry stopped for a moment. The dragon sniffed the coins, turned his nose up at them and went back to his crying.\n\nBy the time evening had fallen and I had set up camp, the cry had become ingrained in my head as the most irritating noise ever, and my new jacket was completely destroyed on the right shoulder.\n\nPulling the jacket over my head, I finally fell asleep with the screaming still continuing.\n\n-_-_-_-\n\nWaking up the next morning was peaceful... and surprising. The desperate cries of the dragon had finally stopped and I could finally think again.\n\nLooking around, I couldn't see the dragon anywhere. Everything else was the same, I still had all my possessions, I still had a hole in my new jacket. I was just down a dragon.\n\nGood riddance. I thought as I gathered up my stuff.\n\nFinally picking up my coin purse, I was surprised by the odd lump that occupied it.\n\nSlowly peaking in, I could see a slightly larger dragon sleeping away on what looked like 15 new silver coins!\n\nSlowly closing the bag, I wondered to myself... what would happen if I did it again?",

With a high pitched battle cry, the small reptile flung itself back at me and attached itself to my shoulder.\n\nOne second it was fine, sure it's claws dug a little deep into my brand new coat, but it had seemed to calm down. The next second a high pitched cry was released from it's mouth, directly into my ear.\n\nThis cry went on for 10 minutes before I tried to bribe the creature.\n\n\"Here dragon,\" I tsk'd lightly, holding up a gold coin. \"I'm sorry I gave away your silver coins but you can have this one!\"\n\nThe high pitched squeal didn't stop.\n\nEventually on the road I met a couple travelers who were all too happy to trade me 3 silver coins for my gold coin. A complete rip off if you asked me, but I was desperate.\n\nHolding the coins out to the dragon as a peace offering, the cry stopped for a moment. The dragon sniffed the coins, turned his nose up at them and went back to his crying.\n\nBy the time evening had fallen and I had set up camp, the cry had become ingrained in my head as the most irritating noise ever, and my new jacket was completely destroyed on the right shoulder.\n\nPulling the jacket over my head, I finally fell asleep with the screaming still continuing.\n\n-_-_-_-\n\nWaking up the next morning was peaceful... and surprising. The desperate cries of the dragon had finally stopped and I could finally think again.\n\nLooking around, I couldn't see the dragon anywhere. Everything else was the same, I still had all my possessions, I still had a hole in my new jacket. I was just down a dragon.\n\nGood riddance. I thought as I gathered up my stuff.\n\nFinally picking up my coin purse, I was surprised by the odd lump that occupied it.\n\nSlowly peaking in, I could see a slightly larger dragon sleeping away on what looked like 15 new silver coins!\n\nSlowly closing the bag, I wondered to myself... what would happen if I did it again?",

        "story": "The myth of Dragons have been greatly misrepresented over the years. The first falsehood being that they were in fact a myth, the second being that they were large and terrifying reptiles set on destroying mankind.\n\nA dragon's size was directly proportionate to the size of it's gold hoard, but no dragon has ever gotten more than one or two coins. There are rumors that Mr. Chinue at the top of the hill has a large dragon, protecting his large pile of gold, but personally I just think they're rumors. Shop keepers especially, are good about keeping the dragon coins away from the non-dragon coins.\n\nThat was another falsehood, Dragons don't care who owns the coin, as long as they travel with it. Most people when they go shopping, take their little coin purse complete with a dragon. The tricky part is making sure to trade the entirety of the Dragon's hoard, as not to upset the dragon. Some people have to pay for a tiny loaf of bread with a whole gold coin just to keep the dragon happy. You can't split it up, which is why most dragons only have small hoards.\n\nIt really is a pain when you're looking to buy and the shop keeper doesn't have a dragon hoard the correct size to give you proper change. Sometimes you get lucky and get a little more back, but more often than not you get shorted change. This is just an expectation now when you go shopping.\n\nTaking a dragon from it's hoard can be dangerous, it's not going to burn down a village but you might lose a finger, and the dragon will ALWAYS find it's way back to its hoard.\n\nWhich is actually my current problem right now. See, I just learned all of this about dragons today. Like 5 minutes ago in fact. Dragons aren't common in the western province where I am from, but here in the eastern province? They're everywhere!\n\nSo when I spent my gold coin earlier, I got 3 silver coins and a tiny dragon back in change. Then when I saw a jacket, I spent 2 of my silver coins. Unfortunately unaware of the consequences that would follow this action.\n\nYou see, my dragon was sleeping when I had spent his coins. It wasn't until later, when I was on my way back to the Western province, that I heard the high pitched wail from inside my coin purse.\n\nConfused by the sound of distress, I peaked in and immediately got a tiny green dragon attached to my nose.\n\nWith a startled yelp, I swiped at my face sending the dragon tumbling towards the ground. With a high pitched battle cry, the small reptile flung itself back at me and attached itself to my shoulder.\n\nOne second it was fine, sure it's claws dug a little deep into my brand new coat, but it had seemed to calm down.

Luck could hardly be seen, her golden sequined dress sparkled and flashed in the spotlight so much that it hurt the eyes. Worries were serious again, typical, mouse-gray suits, even the ties weren't very creative, but of first, expensive quality. Joy was wrapped in yellow and had a huge sunflower pinned to her dress. Quite vulgar for Trouble's taste, but Trouble was just a little pinched, you could tell just by looking at his dark green suit. \"Green, please, only losers wear that,\" Malice whispered to her neighbor, Envy.\n\nOnce again, the two couldn't separate. All evening, they huddled together in one corner, trashing the others. \"Look at Love\", Envy hissed to Malice. \"Where the hell did she find that dress? Squeaky pink and these flounces. Sinfully expensive designer, of course, and she can't even afford it.\" \"She looks like a cake\", Malice returned, \"Fat buttercream.\"\n\nAs Sex entered the brightly lit hall, a murmur went through the crowd. His skin-tight snakeskin suit exposed his beautifully sculpted body more than it concealed it. Eroticism took a large sip of champagne at the sight of him and drew attention with her throaty laugh. Her discreet evening dress shimmered in a velvety red.\n\nIllness had retreated to a quiet table in the corner. Her white dress competed with her noble pallor, and she toasted Death with a glass of chamomile tea. As usual, Death had settled stealthily behind a pillar and pulled his black hat down over his face that most didn't even recognize him.\n\nHonor, as pretty much at every party, was walking around smoking cigarettes. \"Embarrassing,\" thought Pride, wiping the sweat from his forehead. \"Come on\", said Kindness, \"Poor Honor can't afford cigarettes after all,\" and surreptitiously slipped her a packet. Fame was almost drunk. He stood in the corner and bawled, encouraged by big Money, who stood next to him and pretty much fogged him with his Havana.\n\nPower, of course, had shown up with his entire court. Fear was constantly scurrying around them, and Diligence was fetching drinks.\n\nWork was busy as always. She constantly had to add the cold plates on the buffet, and somehow the spoons seemed to have run out. Then the host stepped to the microphone. He was dressed very colorfully and looked a bit like a harlequin. \"Oh God, now he's giving a speech too, and he can't even speak,\" Malice whispered to her best friend.\n\n\"Dear friends, dear partners\", Life began a little hesitantly, \"I'm glad you all came to celebrate me today. I'm especially pleased to have my guests of honor with me. I warmly welcome her Excellency, Happiness and the ambassador of the heart, Love, the mysterious Eroticism, the wild Sex, the almighty Money and of course, my good friend, Joy. Let's have a nice party together, and please don't go home too early.\"\n\nThunderous applause rushed through the hall. People toasted each other and when the music started, Sex and Eroticism danced a tango that even Malice was speechless.\n\nAn old Lady plucked her lace handkerchief and dabbed her eyes, then resolutely closed her purse and hurried to the exit. Wisdom, also not quite dewy, saw it and hurried to the host.\n\n\"Dear Life, you forgot to greet your most important guest,\" she muttered to Life. Life looked in the direction Wisdom was pointing.\n\n\"Oh, I'm a douche,\" Life insulted himself, \"I must've committed a great faux pas.\" Life rushed to the exit and held the old lady. \"Please, I'd like to introduce you to the other guests\", he tried to apologize.\n\n\"My son, there's no need. I know them all, believe me, but I am usually not recognized. And the only ones who will miss me are Trouble, Sorrow, Illness, and Death. But they're pretty boring, young man,\" said the old lady.\n\n\"I will miss you,\" said Life.\n\nThe old Lady handed her business card to Life and disappeared.\n\nLife plunged back into the party scene. Money and Love flirted over the rim of the glass, and Life and Joy danced a waltz. Of course, Love left the party with her old habit.\n\nWhen all the guests had finally left - Luck and Fame once again totally drunk - Life took the old woman's business card out of his pocket and read:\n\nSatisfaction\n\nDifficult to reach\n\nTry more often",

        "story": "They had all come to the big party. Sorrow wore black, of course, with a sophisticated little lace veil. Luck could hardly be seen, her golden sequined dress sparkled and flashed in the spotlight so much that it hurt the eyes. Worries were serious again, typical, mouse-gray suits, even the ties weren't very creative, but of first, expensive quality. Joy was wrapped in yellow and had a huge sunflower pinned to her dress. Quite vulgar for Trouble's taste, but Trouble was just a little pinched, you could tell just by looking at his dark green suit. \"Green, please, only losers wear that,\" Malice whispered to her neighbor, Envy.\n\nOnce again, the two couldn't separate. All evening, they huddled together in one corner, trashing the others. \"Look at Love\", Envy hissed to Malice. \"Where the hell did she find that dress? Squeaky pink and these flounces. Sinfully expensive designer, of course, and she can't even afford it.\" \"She looks like a cake\", Malice returned, \"Fat buttercream.\"\n\nAs Sex entered the brightly lit hall, a murmur went through the crowd. His skin-tight snakeskin suit exposed his beautifully sculpted body more than it concealed it. Eroticism took a large sip of champagne at the sight of him and drew attention with her throaty laugh. Her discreet evening dress shimmered in a velvety red.\n\nIllness had retreated to a quiet table in the corner. Her white dress competed with her noble pallor, and she toasted Death with a glass of chamomile tea. As usual, Death had settled stealthily behind a pillar and pulled his black hat down over his face that most didn't even recognize him.\n\nHonor, as pretty much at every party, was walking around smoking cigarettes. \"Embarrassing,\" thought Pride, wiping the sweat from his forehead. \"Come on\", said Kindness, \"Poor Honor can't afford cigarettes after all,\" and surreptitiously slipped her a packet. Fame was almost drunk. He stood in the corner and bawled, encouraged by big Money, who stood next to him and pretty much fogged him with his Havana.\n\nPower, of course, had shown up with his entire court. Fear was constantly scurrying around them, and Diligence was fetching drinks.\n\nWork was busy as always. She constantly had to add the cold plates on the buffet, and somehow the spoons seemed to have run out. Then the host stepped to the microphone. He was dressed very colorfully and looked a bit like a harlequin. \"Oh God, now he's giving a speech too, and he can't even speak,\" Malice whispered to her best friend.\n\n\"Dear friends, dear partners\", Life began a little hesitantly, \"I'm glad you all came to celebrate me today. I'm especially pleased to have my guests of honor with me. I warmly welcome her Excellency, Happiness and the ambassador of the heart, Love, the mysterious Eroticism, the wild Sex, the almighty Money and of course, my good friend, Joy. Let's have a nice party together, and please don't go home too early.\"\n\nThunderous applause rushed through the hall. People toasted each other and when the music started, Sex and Eroticism danced a tango that even Malice was speechless.\n\nAn old Lady plucked her lace handkerchief and dabbed her eyes, then resolutely closed her purse and hurried to the exit. Wisdom, also not quite dewy, saw it and hurried to the host.\n\n\"Dear Life, you forgot to greet your most important guest,\" she muttered to Life. Life looked in the direction Wisdom was pointing.\n\n\"Oh, I'm a douche,\" Life insulted himself, \"I must've committed a great faux pas.\" Life rushed to the exit and held the old lady. \"Please, I'd like to introduce you to the other guests\", he tried to apologize.\n\n\"My son, there's no need. I know them all, believe me, but I am usually not recognized. And the only ones who will miss me are Trouble, Sorrow, Illness, and Death. But they're pretty boring, young man,\" said the old lady.\n\n\"I will miss you,\" said Life.\n\nThe old Lady handed her business card to Life and disappeared.\n\nLife plunged back into the party scene. Money and Love flirted over the rim of the glass, and Life and Joy danced a waltz. Of course, Love left the party with her old habit.\n\nWhen all the guests had finally left - Luck and Fame once again totally drunk - Life took the old woman's business card out of his pocket and read:\n\nSatisfaction\n\nDifficult to reach\n\nTry more often",

Across my back I carry a weight that drags me down like an anchor, threatening to trap me in this cave forever. \n\nIt was worth it.\n\nMy brother and I were on an archaeological excavation in the Yucat\u00e1n when we discovered an unknown temple. As we ecstatically began to explore its depths, we found a painting of an idol. An idol with glowing blue eyes and a black, sinewy form. So eerie, and yet so intriguing and beautiful it defied comprehension. We became obsessed with finding it. At first we believed it would be at the site, but it quickly became evident that this wasn't the case. After days spent scouring the ruins we abandoned our prestigious dig, including the new temple, and made for the city. \n\nIt was worth it. \n\nWe scoured the market.  We talked to gurus, shamans, con men, and se\u00f1oras selling fruit on the ground. We begged every person we talked to for any rumor, myth, or legend they knew about the idol. We spent every penny we had until we were beggars, dependent on the charity of those around us for food and shelter. \n\nIt was worth it. \n\nFinally, we got our break deep within the recesses of a souvenir shop. The owner led us past rows of cheap clothing and knick knacks to her private office, where she pulled a book from a dusty shelf. The book showed the way to an island shrouded in pink clouds, an island with a cave protecting an idol with bright blue eyes and a dark body. \n\nThe shop owner insisted we abandon our search. She spoke of the corruptive powers of the idol, and the potential harm its bearer could bring on themselves and others. We didn't listen. When it became clear we intended to take the book, the shop owner tried to grab it and run.

Surrounding it was a lake of magma, the heat so intense it singed our faces. \n\nThere was no voice, no writing, nothing to indicate our next step. But we knew anyway. The idol demanded a life in return for its possession. Something snapped inside my brother. For the first time in our quest, fear and doubt filled his expression.

Does he believe that there really is a serial killer who preys on the city every half moon? Will police discover new victims by the time the sun rises tomorrow? Find out tomorrow at seven.\"*\n\n\"What a load of bullshit.\" Mike said. He saw the look on my face and said \"What, you don't believe in that nonsense, do you Karla?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" I said.\n\nFor almost a year, there had been reports of a serial killer who killed in various parts of East Los Angeles anytime there was a half moon. Personally, I didn't know what to make of it; it was strange, but this was Los Angeles, someone somewhere in the city was getting stabbed on a given night no matter what shape the moon was.\n\nAnyway, the three of us (Mike, Danielle, and I) were driving home that night, the night of a half moon, after spending time at a friend's party. Even though I thought there was some truth to The Halfmoon Killer, I still thought we were safe going home since we were driving.\n\nAnd then, there was a man on the road.\n\nMike stopped the car to avoid hitting him. \"HEY BUDDY, CAN YOU GET OFF THE STREET?\" He asked.\n\nThen, the man stepped forward. Once he was in the light of the car's headlights, we could see that he was dressed really odd; he wore a black tracksuit, with a bright white mask.\n\nHe pulled out a gun and shot the front two tires. He then put the gun away and pulled a knife; then he charged towards us.\n\n\"FUCK!\" Mike shouted as he rolled up his window and locked the doors, but that wasn't gonna stop the killer. The Halfmoon Killer broke through the window with his hand, grabbed Mike, and pulled him in closer, where he then stabbed his heart.\n\n\"NO!\" I screamed before frantically getting out of the car. Danielle followed suit, and we began running down the street.\n\nWe were in a commercial area of the city, one that had been closed for hours. Danielle and I ran around the outside of a closed Dollar Tree, hiding amongst the dumpsters.\n\nWe heard the killer stop moving. He didn't know where we were, but was clearly still searching. At that point, Danielle got out her phone and dialed 911.\n\n\"911, what is your emergency?\" we barely heard. The volume on her phone was set to almost nothing to avoid the killer hearing it. She even covered the screen so it wouldn't get seen.\n\n\"We're on Garcia avenue.\" She whispered. \"The Halfmoon Killer, he's real, and he just killed our...\"\n\nHe then found us. The Halfmoon Killer came charging, and got to Danielle before she could even stand up. He pinned her against a wall, and stabbed her right in the heart.\n\nI took off running. I lost him by turning the corner and dashing towards a nearby convenience store (literally the only place I saw whose lights were on).\n\n\"Miss, you okay?\" The cashier asked.\n\n\"HELP ME, PLEASE!\" I shouted. \"THE HALFMOON KILLER, HE'S REAL AND HE'S...\"\n\nMoments later, a bullet flew through the window and hit the cashier in the head.\n\n\"SHIT.\" I said as I ran into the aisles to take cover.\n\nThe killer walked in and said \"The moon demands three sacrifices. All I need is to pierce your heart, and I will be finished for the night.\"\n\nI found myself next to a rack of beer packs. I carefully pulled out a bottle, stood up, and threw it at his head.\n\n\"OW!\" He shouted in pain. I then grabbed another bottle, ran up to him, and hit him on the head.\n\nHe fell and dropped the knife. I tried to run to grab it, but he grabbed me by the ankle and pulled me down with him.\n\nHe then started choking me. \"You will be my sacrifice; the moon will get what it's owed.\"\n\nJust as I was losing consciousness, I felt where he was concealing his gun. I pulled it out, and shot him in the stomach.\n\n\"AAAHHH!\" he screamed in pain. I then crawled out from underneath him, and shot him one last time, in the head.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n*Two months later...*\n\n*\"And at 8, be sure to tune in to our special, The Halfmoon Killer: Terror of Los Angeles, where we get an exclusive interview from Karla Santacruz, the young woman who heroically stopped killer's rampage in a convenience store.\"*\n\n*\"And tomorrow, we talk to the Los Angeles PD about the Fullmoon Killer.

He saw the look on my face and said \"What, you don't believe in that nonsense, do you Karla?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" I said.\n\nFor almost a year, there had been reports of a serial killer who killed in various parts of East Los Angeles anytime there was a half moon. Personally, I didn't know what to make of it; it was strange, but this was Los Angeles, someone somewhere in the city was getting stabbed on a given night no matter what shape the moon was.\n\nAnyway, the three of us (Mike, Danielle, and I) were driving home that night, the night of a half moon, after spending time at a friend's party. Even though I thought there was some truth to The Halfmoon Killer, I still thought we were safe going home since we were driving.\n\nAnd then, there was a man on the road.\n\nMike stopped the car to avoid hitting him. \"HEY BUDDY, CAN YOU GET OFF THE STREET?\" He asked.\n\nThen, the man stepped forward. Once he was in the light of the car's headlights, we could see that he was dressed really odd; he wore a black tracksuit, with a bright white mask.\n\nHe pulled out a gun and shot the front two tires. He then put the gun away and pulled a knife; then he charged towards us.\n\n\"FUCK!\" Mike shouted as he rolled up his window and locked the doors, but that wasn't gonna stop the killer. The Halfmoon Killer broke through the window with his hand, grabbed Mike, and pulled him in closer, where he then stabbed his heart.\n\n\"NO!\" I screamed before frantically getting out of the car. Danielle followed suit, and we began running down the street.\n\nWe were in a commercial area of the city, one that had been closed for hours. Danielle and I ran around the outside of a closed Dollar Tree, hiding amongst the dumpsters.\n\nWe heard the killer stop moving. He didn't know where we were, but was clearly still searching. At that point, Danielle got out her phone and dialed 911.\n\n\"911, what is your emergency?\" we barely heard. The volume on her phone was set to almost nothing to avoid the killer hearing it. She even covered the screen so it wouldn't get seen.\n\n\"We're on Garcia avenue.\" She whispered. \"The Halfmoon Killer, he's real, and he just killed our...\"\n\nHe then found us. The Halfmoon Killer came charging, and got to Danielle before she could even stand up. He pinned her against a wall, and stabbed her right in the heart.\n\nI took off running. I lost him by turning the corner and dashing towards a nearby convenience store (literally the only place I saw whose lights were on).\n\n\"Miss, you okay?\" The cashier asked.\n\n\"HELP ME, PLEASE!\" I shouted. \"THE HALFMOON KILLER, HE'S REAL AND HE'S...\"\n\nMoments later, a bullet flew through the window and hit the cashier in the head.\n\n\"SHIT.\" I said as I ran into the aisles to take cover.\n\nThe killer walked in and said \"The moon demands three sacrifices.

        "story": "Crooked fingers shakily grasped a paint brush. Atop a hill overlooking a tranquil cove, he sat. despite the tremble in his now ancient grasp, the painter delivered masterful brush strokes. Each time the bristles lapped against white cloth, a piece of himself travelled across the canvas. The steady sea breeze blew his thinning hair back, and the salt-sprayed onto his pores. Never before had he known such peace. \n\nThe violent crashing of wave against rock, the melody of seagulls soaring overhead, the slow marching onward of clouds, it was a perfect evening. The once yellow sun now burned orange as it slowly hid its face from view. The sky itself was beginning to yawn and show new colors as day transitioned into night. Slowly, as he laid paint on canvas, the scene became indistinguishable from the painting the man sat in front of. \n\nA cloud of smoke leaked from a young pair of lips.\n\n\"I thought you gave up painting Cosmo.\" A familiar voice broke through the air. The young man pulled again from the cigarette dangling out of his mouth. \n\n\"And I thought I told you that those things will kill you.\" the old man replied with a voice scarred from years of use. The young man briefly raised his shoulders in apathetic protest, and contnued to smoke. \n\n\"Yes, but it was also you that taught me that all things end. If I'm going to die one day, what does it matter?\" he replied. \n\n\"That wasn't what I hoped you'd learned from the lesson Mark.\" He replied with a voice tinged in dissapointment. His trembling hand laid one last stroke of paint on the canvas before he put the brush down. The two men sat in silence admiring the work Cosmo had done. The painting was nothing short of a masterpiece. The old man had dipped a paintbrush into his own heart and painted his very essence onto a canvas. The strokes of his brush and the strategically placed combination of colors created something more beautiful than the location itself.\n\n\"Cosmo, it's amazing.\" Mark said, awestruck, as he placed a hand on Cosmo's shoulder. \n\n\"I never thought I would be able to hold a brush again. After that first brush stroke, it was like I never stopped.\" The man smiled, and a tear rolled down his cheek. \n\n\"Without a doubt, it's your most beautiful work.\" Mark said. \n\n\"I'm glad you like it.\" Cosmo's crooked, wrinkled fingers fished a metallic rectangle from his pocket. He flicked the lighter open and held the flame to the edge of the painting. Orange flames began to creep up the edges of the painting, producing a hauntingly beautiful glow of orange.\n\n\"Hey! What are you doing? That belonged in a museum. It deserved to be studied.\" Mark said frustrated. Cosmo's wrinkled mouth cracked into a smile as he looked up at Mark then back to the burning easel. \n\n In the brief moments of pure destruction, coupled with the harmony of nature around them, a secret hidden beauty that few men ever see was revealed. The painting was destroyed. For the few seconds that it was engulfed in flames, the two men observed an image more enchanting than both the painting and the scene itself. \n\n\"It's what I was trying to teach you.\" Mark looked at him confused. \"Life is not meaningless because it is short. Quite the opposite. Life matters because it only lasts for so long. The painting was beautiful, yes, but what was even more beautiful were the moments when flames danced off the edges of the canvas. It created something else, a different form of art entirely. Now, its gone. It only lives on in our memories. The painting may have only existed for a brief moment, but it made an impact, and it was beautiful. \" Cosmo said as he gazed out towards the waters. \"In the grand scheme of time, our lives are but a blink, a tear dropped in the ocean. The brevity of life, tragic as it may be , is what makes living magical.\" Mark said nothing. He plucked the cigarette out of his mouth and flung it over the side of the cliff. The two men sat in contemplation for a moment. \n\n\"Life is made of these little moments. Nothing lasts, and that is what makes them worth while.\" Mark said wistfully. \n\n\"Now you understand.\" Cosmo said with a smile in his voice. The two men observed the crashing of the waves. Each one forming a crescendo, slamming into the side of rocks, and dissipating back into the sea, never to be seen again.",
