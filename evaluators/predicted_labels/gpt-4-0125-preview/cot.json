Instead, as he approaches, the mermaid turns into a seal, and he crashes the boat before he can get to the rock.\n\n2. The summary omits the transitions between Daniel's experiences on the beach, his unconsciousness, and his time in the hospital, which are significant because they add to the surreal and dream-like quality of the narrative. These transitions are crucial for understanding the confusion and blending of reality and dreams that Daniel experiences.\n\n3. The summary mentions that when Daniel jumps into the water the second time, the seal bites him, but his skin breaks the teeth. This detail is slightly misrepresented. In the story, this event is part of Daniel's dream or hallucination, where he gains a sense of control or power over his situation, symbolized by his skin breaking the seal's teeth.
